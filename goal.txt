So Foco, which is the dining services at Downwood, they have this website where you can basically check the menu, what are offered and all of the different places on campus. The good thing about it is that they have a calorie right, so for example I'm dieting right now and I'm like, "Oh that's cool, I would like to stay under 1500 calories." The thing is that the UI is so bad, like you have to go and click on each of them and so on and so on and so on so now I was thinking about this website where basically you will go and tell it your Calorie thing and stuff, and it's going to be like "hey, okay based on that and number of me at launch, this is going to be available." This is like a nice meal protein and stuff in a lot of the same basically. The goal is to help me diet, and again if you can be helpful to other people, why not? But I'm just curious about how.

For the scraping that's the tough part, lots of JavaScript, lots of whatever they have out there. But I was thinking maybe we can set up a browser-based agent that will go in each day at midnight and scrape what's available. It will click on each menu between breakfast, lunch, and dinner and be like, "Hey, check the calories, save the calories in a database because those calories won't change most likely."

So we are populating a database, and if something already exists, we don't add it anymore, whatever. Right? And then during the day, it can just tell me, "go to Foco, get this, this, this, you are going to stay under 1500 or 2000 and whatever." I think that would be a really useful verb, because the UI right now is bad.
